#### Introduction of myself
<br><br>
Hello, I am Max, a 14 year old programmer, designer and geek based in Germany. I am currently studying at a gymnasium in Berlin, Germany, where I will graduate in a few years. My hobbies are mainly sports activities like swimming, cycling and running, although I also enjoy programming and developing.
<br><br>
When it comes to programming, my strengths are mainly Python, C++, NodeJS and web development. When I do need to know something else for a project or an order, then I can very easily acquire that knowledge.
